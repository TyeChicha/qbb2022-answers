Great work Tye. Everything you have is almost completly correct. One very minor point: you were meant to color the tSNE and UMAP by the leiden cluster (which you can do with a quick `color='leiden'` argument in the plotting function (no points deducted)

For full credit, we still need support plots, and the final labeled tSNE or UMAP for Step 4. As a hint: you can use the databse we linked to find the cell types associated with certain marker genes (which you can find from your plots for Step 3), and then you can change the cluster names based on these cell types (maybe using the `.map()` method...).  (-4 points)

Great work though!
