Great work! Just couple minor issues:
1. Missing your answer for question 2 (-0.5 point)
2. For Question 3C, just because they're inconsistent number of contigs doesn't necessarily mean anything is wrong... the contigs could be different lengths. How would we go about actually calculating the length (in bp) of each bin? (-1 point)

Overall though, very well done!
