92% are valid interactions and of the invalid 3c pairs nearly all are dangling end pairs. This means "low quality experiment, and reveals a problem during the digestion, fill-in or ligation steps." according to the hicpro manual.

part2
i could not see the highlighted difference. There also is a difference in my plot for some reason. not sure how to fix.

depth influences the disance i can see interactions. more depth alloows me to see long distance interactions as well as resolve differences in interactions much better.

this area represents interactions that were not present in the dCTCF but did apear in the ddCTCF.

insulation

unfortunately i could not get to this part as the previous section took me a million uyears
